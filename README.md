# Learn-Linux-Boot-Folders-With-Shell-Scripts
In this repository, i did not upload a complete discussion about the boot folder on the linux operating system because the explanation was too complicated, so i translated everything into indonesian. to study in focus, you can inspect the boot folder yourself according to each distro and understand each available extension. because there are so many explanations for each configuration file, i'll just summarize it to the basics.

# language
